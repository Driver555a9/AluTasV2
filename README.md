# AluTasV2

## About AluTasV2:
  - Early stage of development - thus far only free flight has been implemented.
  - The tool does not rely on Cheat Engine whatsoever anymore, it instead manually manipulates game memory
  - It can not be used in any way to gain a competitive advantage in a race, it is made to be scientific
  - You may enjoy the beautiful landscapes, discover new shortcuts, or take make wallpapers

## How to use:
  - As of now, this utility only works for the Steam version (I'll perhaps add ms eventually)
  - As everything is statically linked, you should only require the .exe file, no external dependencies or dll
  - Run the .exe as administrator and it should detect the Asphalt Legends automatically
  - You for some reason must not use "uncapped" fps in game, limit them to 120fps
