# AluTasV2

## What it does:
  - Early stage of development (thus far only free flight has been implemented)
  - The tool does not rely on Cheat Engine whatsoever, it instead manually manipulates game memory using libmem
  - It ought not to be used in any way to gain a competitive advantage in a race, it is made to be scientific
  - You may enjoy the beautiful landscapes, discover new shortcuts, or take wallpaper pictures

## How to use:
  - As of now, this utility only works for the Steam version (I'll perhaps fix MS eventually)
  - As everything is statically linked, you should only require the .exe file, no external dependencies or dll
  - Run the .exe as administrator and it should detect Asphalt Legends automatically
  - You for some reason must **not** use "uncapped" fps in game, limit them to 120fps
  - Controls: WASD, space = up, left ctrl = down
