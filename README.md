\# AluTasV2



Early stage of development - thus far only free flight has been implemented.

How to use:

-As of now, this utility only works for the Steam version (I'll perhaps add ms eventually)

-As everything is statically linked, you should only require the .exe file

-Run it as administrator and it should detect the Game automatically

-To use free flight: You must not use "uncapped" fps in game, limit them to 120fps
